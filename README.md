## Who I Am

I'm not here to just push commits.  
I'm here to push the boundaries of who gets to win in tech.

From scaling systems at Meta and Walmart to building Zero2DataEngineer from scratch, my mission is clear:  
Create an ecosystem where 500,000+ engineers launch high-growth tech careers, regardless of where they start.

This GitHub isn't about personal branding.  
It's about public building.  
Every repo here is a resource for someone trying to break in, level up, or lead.
